RigidBodyDynamics.jl is a rigid body dynamics library in pure Julia. It aims to be **user friendly** and [**performant**](https://github.com/JuliaRobotics/RigidBodyDynamics.jl/blob/master/docs/src/benchmarks.md), but also **generic** in the sense that the algorithms can be called with inputs of any (suitable) scalar types. This means that if fast numeric dynamics evaluations are required, a user can supply `Float64` or `Float32` inputs. However, if symbolic quantities are desired for analysis purposes, they can be obtained by calling the algorithms with e.g. [`SymPy.Sym`](https://github.com/JuliaPy/SymPy.jl) inputs. If gradients are required, e.g. the [`ForwardDiff.Dual`](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl) type, which implements forward-mode [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation), can be used.

See the [latest stable documentation](https://JuliaRobotics.github.io/RigidBodyDynamics.jl/stable/) for a list of features, installation instructions, and a quick-start guide. Installation should only take a couple of minutes, including installing Julia itself. See the [notebooks directory](https://github.com/JuliaRobotics/RigidBodyDynamics.jl/tree/master/notebooks) for some usage examples.

* August 23, 2017: a video of a JuliaCon 2017 talk given by Robin Deits and Twan Koolen on using Julia for robotics [has been uploaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPYc77M90Qg). It includes a brief demo of RigidBodyDynamics.jl and RigidBodyTreeInspector.jl. Note that RigidBodyDynamics.jl performance has significantly improved since this talk. The margins of the slides have unfortunately been cut off somewhat in the video.
